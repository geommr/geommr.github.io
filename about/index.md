### I currently live in Dortmund, Germany but I call many places home. I'm finishing my bachelor's in CS next year and in the meantime, I'm either working on a side project, reading a [good book](https://goodreads.com/georgemamar) or training.

### I enjoy late evening jogs (literally and in the coding-sense) and I recently got into [photography](https://instagram.com/georgemamar).
